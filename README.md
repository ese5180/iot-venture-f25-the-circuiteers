## Concept Development

The vending machine industry represents a $22-25 billion global market [2] with a critical need for smart health monitoring systems, as traditional maintenance approaches are bleeding operators dry with hidden costs that eliminate profits for 73% of independent vending operators [1]. Current maintenance expenses range from $100-500 annually per machine, with monthly checks costing $50-100 and service incidents adding $50-200 each time, creating a maintenance burden that can constitute up to 15% of total operational costs [1]. By using sensors to monitor component health in real-time—such as power draw, temperature, and dispensing motor function—operators can preempt failures before they happen, a practice that can reduce maintenance costs by up to 25% over time. [3] Take a mid-sized vending operator with a fleet of 100 machines, the total annual maintenance contract cost would be $60,000 ($600/machine x 100 machines). A 25% reduction means an annual saving of $15,000. A health monitoring system prevents costly emergency repairs, optimizes service routes to eliminate unnecessary trips, and cuts product waste from overstocking or machine malfunctions. By transforming vending machines from static boxes into efficient, reliable, and more profitable assets, a smart health monitoring system provides a clear and rapid return on investment.

### Product Function

### Target Market & Demographics


- Primary Users: Vending machine operators, fleet managers, and maintenance technicians who need real-time visibility into machine health across distributed locations.

- Primary Customers: Commercial vending companies, facilities management companies, and large-scale vending operators managing 50+ machines.

- Geographic Deployment: Initially targeting the United States market, with expansion planned for urban areas in Canada and Europe where vending machine density is highest.

- Market Size: The global vending machine market size in 2024 was USD 23065.3 million, and is estimated to reach USD 25879.3 million in 2025 and is projected to reach USD 34959.4 million by 2030 with a CAGR of 6.20%. According to NMSC, in term of volume the market size was 12 million units in 2024, and is estimated to reach 15 million units in 2025 and is projected to reach 23 million units by 2030 with a CAGR of 9.3%.

- Competitors: While asset monitoring systems (Augury) and smart (with capabilities to track sales, suggest products to purchase, do inventory monitring etc.) vending machines  exist (BetterHealth Vending, SMRT1 Technologies, Velocity Smart), there appears to be a gap in the area of health monitoring systems specifically for vending machines.
